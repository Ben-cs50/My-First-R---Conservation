To conduct the analysis using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Python Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Optionally, set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

2. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - Import libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

3. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Use pandas to read the "Wild Tomorrow Survey Responses" dataset into a DataFrame.

4. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Remove duplicate or irrelevant entries using pandas functions like drop_duplicates().
   - Handle missing values using methods like dropna() or filling them with appropriate values.
   - Ensure consistency in data formats.

5. **Select Relevant Fields:**
   - Identify at least five fields from the dataset that align with the purpose of the survey.
   - Create a new DataFrame containing only these fields for analysis.

6. **Compare Pre and Post Surveys:**
   - Subset the data into pre and post surveys.
   - Analyze and compare responses between pre and post surveys using pandas functionalities and statistical tests if necessary.

7. **Visualization:**
   - Utilize matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, or pie charts to illustrate key findings.
   - Customize visualizations with Lessons in Conservation's brand colors and fonts.

8. **Interpretation and Reporting:**
   - Interpret the analysis findings clearly, highlighting any significant trends or insights.
   - Summarize the impact of lessons based on the analysis.
   - Prepare a report in PDF format with explanations for each visualization.

9. **Submission:**
   - Ensure the completed report and Python script are ready by the specified deadline.
   - Submit the report and script to the designated email address.

10. **Contact:**
   - Provide your contact information for any questions or clarifications regarding the analysis.

With Python, you can accomplish the same analysis objectives outlined in the README. Ensure to adhere to the instructions provided by Lessons in Conservation's Statistics team and make necessary adjustments to your analysis approach based on their requirements.
